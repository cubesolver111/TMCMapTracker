## Variants

This pack currently offers four variants:
1. Map Tracker
2. Items-Only
3. Keysanity Map tracker
4. Keysanity Items-Only

## Settings

There are currently 5 settings as there is only one mode for the randomizer. As the randomizer progresses, other settings will be added.

The pot represents obscure locations. This means some pots, digging spots, and diving spots are also randomized.
The Kinstone bag represents the kinsanity mode.
  In open, all fusions are completed from the start of the game and the locations they unlock will be considered in logic.
  In none, all fusions are vanilla, but the rewards are not randomized.
The Darknut represents the Dark Hyrule Castle requirement.
  In Closed, the requirement is the same as vanilla. You must get the Four Sword and the Four Elements.
  In Open, DHC is open from the beginning of the game, so you just have to find the items needed to beat the dungeon and the final boss
  In Ped, DHC is open and items are shuffled onto the pedestal, with checks added after you get 2, 3, and 4 elements.
  In None, the game ends when you go to the pedestal after completing the set goal of getting a certain number of swords and/or elements.
The Sword indicates the required number of swords to get for when DHC is set to none.
The Elements indicates the required number of elements to get for when DHC is set to none.

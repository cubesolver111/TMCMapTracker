# TMCMapTracker

## Content

This is a pack for [EmoTracker](https://emotracker.net/) designed for the [Minish Cap Randomizer](https://rando.minishmaker.com/).
You can easily download it from within the EmoTracker application.

This pack allows you to keep track of the items you've collected and what item locations you can reach with those items.

## Variants

This pack currently offers two variants:
1. Map Tracker
2. Items-Only

When other modes for the randomizer become available, the tracker will also be updated for those modes. Currently there are two modes in development: Keysanity and Kinsanity.

## Settings

For the moment, heart pieces are not randomized. However, if you press the ![Hearts On] button, you can see the location of heart pieces should you wish to grab some extra health. Once heart pieces are randomized, this setting will be removed.

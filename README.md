## Content

This is a pack for [EmoTracker](https://emotracker.net/) designed for the [Minish Cap Randomizer](https://rando.minishmaker.com/).
You can easily download it from within the EmoTracker application.

This pack allows you to keep track of the items you've collected and what item locations you can reach with those items.

## Variants

This pack currently offers four variants:
1. Map Tracker
2. Items-Only
3. Keysanity Map tracker
4. Keysanity Items-Only

When other modes for the randomizer become available, the tracker will also be updated for those modes. Currently there is one more mode in development: Kinsanity.

## Settings

There are currently no settings as there is only one mode for the randomizer. As the randomizer progresses, settings will be added. Right now, the proposed settings are open, standard, and full.

In open, all fusions are completed from the start of the game and the locations they unlock will be considered in logic.
In standard, all fusions are vanilla and will not be considered in logic.
In kinsanity, all fusions are randomized and will be considered in logic.
